we are not gonna make it,nećemo uspeti,0
not against me,ne protiv mene,0
there is no way,nema sanse,0
it cant be,nemoguce,0
sleep well,lepo spavaj,0
you should be ashamed of yourself,treba da se stidiš samog sebe,0
is that clear?,je l jasno?,0
like father like son,kakav otac takav sin,0
you disgust me,gadiš mi se,0
i really appreciate,veoma cenim,0
that sounds great,zvuči odlično,0
i am just about to something,upravo ću nešto raditi,0
single hendedly,na jednostavan način,0
so what?,pa šta?,0
where is the will there's a way,gde postoji volja tu postoji način,0
for a while,za neko vreme,0
you are not even close,nisi ni blizu,0
just like I thought,kao što sam i mislio,0
that makes no sense,To nema nikakvog smisla,0
up for something?,za nešto?,0
i don't get it,ne razumem,0
one of a kind,jedinstven,0
get off,skloni se,0
wake up,budi se,0
just in case,za svaki slučaj,0
stay out of this,ne mešaj se,0
take it or leave it,uzmi ili ostavi,0
get used to,navići se,0
stand out,isticati se,0
feel sorry,zažaliti,0
